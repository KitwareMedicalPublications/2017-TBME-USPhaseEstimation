abstract = {Conventional low frame rate cameras result in blur and/or aliasing in images while capturing fast dynamic events. Multiple low speed cameras have been used previously with staggered sampling to increase the temporal resolution. However, previous approaches are inefficient: they either use small integration time for each camera which does not provide light benefit, or use large integration time in a way that requires solving a big ill-posed linear system. We propose coded sampling that address these issues: using N cameras it allows N times temporal superresolution while allowing \~{}N/2 times more light compared to an equivalent high speed camera. In addition, it results in a well-posed linear system which can be solved independently for each frame, avoiding reconstruction artifacts and significantly reducing the computational time and memory. Our proposed sampling uses optimal multiplexing code considering additive Gaussian noise to achieve the maximum possible SNR in the recovered video. We show how to implement coded sampling on off-the-shelf machine vision cameras. We also propose a new class of invertible codes that allow continuous blur in captured frames, leading to an easier hardware implementation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a temporal super resolution ap- proach for quasi-periodic image sequence such as human gait. The proposed method effectively combines example- based and reconstruction-based temporal super resolution approaches. A periodic image sequence is expressed as a manifold parameterized by a phase and a standard mani- fold is learned from multiple high frame-rate sequences in the training stage. In the test stage, an initial phase for each frame of an input low frame-rate image sequence is estimated based on the standard manifold at first, and the manifold reconstruction and the phase estimation are then iterated to generate better high frame-rate images in the energy minimization framework that ensures the fitness to both the input images and the standard manifold. The pro- posed method is applied to low frame-rate gait recognition and experiments with real data of 100 subjects demonstrate a significant improvement by the proposed method, particu- larly for quite low frame-rate videos (e.g., 1 fps).},

abstract = { This article presents a review of some modern approaches to trend extraction for one-dimensional time series, which is one of the major tasks of time series analysis. The trend of a time series is usually defined as a smooth additive component which contains information about the time series global change, and we discuss this and other definitions of the trend. We do not aim to review all the novel approaches, but rather to observe the problem from different viewpoints and from different areas of expertise. The article contributes to understanding the concept of a trend and the problem of its extraction. We present an overview of advantages and disadvantages of the approaches under consideration, which are: the model-based approach (MBA), nonparametric linear filtering, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), and wavelets. The MBA assumes the specification of a stochastic time series model, which is usually either an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model or a state space model. The nonparametric filtering methods do not require specification of model and are popular because of their simplicity in application. We discuss the Henderson, LOESS, and Hodrick–Prescott filters and their versions derived by exploiting the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space methodology. In addition to these prominent approaches, we consider SSA and wavelet methods. SSA is widespread in the geosciences; its algorithm is similar to that of principal components analysis, but SSA is applied to time series. Wavelet methods are the de facto standard for denoising in signal procession, and recent works revealed their potential in trend analysis.}

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

The specific problem explored is that of estimating the IF of frequency-modulated (FM) discrete-time signals embedded in Gaussian noise. Well-established methods for estimating the IF include differentiation of the phase and smoothing thereof, adaptive frequency estimation techniques such as the phase locked loop (PLL), and extraction of the peak from time-varying spectral representations. More recently, methods based on a modeling of the signal phase as a polynomial have been introduced. These methods are reviewed, and their performance compared on both simulated and real data. Guidelines are given as to which estimation method should be used for a given signal class and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)},

abstract = {Foreground detection is the first step in video surveillance system to detect moving objects. Recent research on subspace estimation by sparse representation and rank minimization represents a nice framework to separate moving objects from the background. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit decomposes a data matrix A in two components such that A=L+S, where L is a low-rank matrix and S is a sparse noise matrix. The background sequence is then modeled by a low-rank subspace that can gradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the correlated sparse outliers. To date, many efforts have been made to develop Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) methods with reduced computational cost that perform visually well in foreground detection. However, no current algorithm seems to emerge and to be able to simultaneously address all the key challenges that accompany real-world videos. This is due, in part, to the absence of a rigorous quantitative evaluation with synthetic and realistic large-scale dataset with accurate ground truth providing a balanced coverage of the range of challenges present in the real world. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of RPCA-PCP based methods for testing and ranking existing algorithms for foreground detection. For this, we first review the recent developments in the field of RPCA solved via Principal Component Pursuit. Furthermore, we investigate how these methods are solved and if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for foreground detection. Finally, experimental results on the Background Models Challenge (BMC) dataset which contains different synthetic and real datasets show the comparative performance of these recent methods. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The main focus of this paper is, first, to define a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm addressing the preservation of structure in a digital image.

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

Recently proposed methods take different approaches to the problem and yet their denoising performances are comparable. A pertinent question then to ask is whether there is a theoretical limit to denoising performance and, more importantly, are we there yet? As camera manufacturers continue to pack increasing numbers of pixels per unit area, an increase in noise sensitivity manifests itself in the form of a noisier image. We study the performance bounds for the image denoising problem. Our work in this paper estimates a lower bound on the mean squared error of the denoised result and compares the performance of current state-of-the-art denoising methods with this bound. We show that despite the phenomenal recent progress in the quality of denoising algorithms, some room for improvement still remains for a wide class of general images, and at certain signal-to-noise levels.

With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

We review the results of an analytic approach describing noise-induced phase synchronization in a thermal two-state system. In this context exact expressions for the mean frequency and the phase diffusivity are obtained that together determine the average length of locking episodes. A recently proposed method to quantify frequency synchronization in noisy potential systems is presented and exemplified by applying it to the periodically driven noisy harmonic oscillator. Since this method is based on a threshold crossing rate pioneered by Rice the related phase velocity is termed the Rice frequency. Finally, we discuss the relation between the phenomenon of stochastic resonance and noise-enhanced phase coherence by applying the developed concepts to the periodically driven bistable Kramers oscillator.},

In fetal echocardiography, where an ECG signal is not readily available, image gating is used, which can both be computationally expensive and/or require user interaction. We present a new image gating technique that has both low computational requirements and is fully automatic.

Two mapping modalities have been used: optical mapping (used to map atria and ventricles) and contact electrode mapping (used only to map ventricles). Due to specific morphology of atrial electrograms, phase reconstruction of contact electrograms in the atria is challenging and has not been investigated in detail. Here, we explore the properties of Hilbert transform applied to unipolar epicardial electrograms and devise a method for robust phase reconstruction using the Hilbert transform. We applied the Hilbert transform to idealized unipolar signals obtained from analytical approach and to electrograms recorded in humans. We investigated effects of deflection morphology on instantaneous phase. Application of the Hilbert transform to unipolar electrograms demonstrated sensitivity of reconstructed phase to the type of deflection morphology (uni- or biphasic), the ratio of R and S waves and presence of the noise. In order to perform a robust phase reconstruction, we propose a signal transformation based on the recomposition of the electrogram from sinusoidal wavelets with amplitudes proportional to the negative slope of the electrogram. Application of the sinusoidal recomposition transformation prior to application of the Hilbert transform alleviates the effect of confounding features on reconstructed phase.},

abstract = { A method for detecting and segmenting periodic motion is presented. We exploit periodicity as a cue and detect periodic motion in complex scenes where common methods for motion segmentation are likely to fail. We note that periodic motion detection can be seen as an approximate case of sequence alignment where an image sequence is matched to itself over one or more periods of time. To use this observation, we first consider alignment of two video sequences obtained by independently moving cameras. Under assumption of constant translation, the fundamental matrices and the homographies are shown to be time-linear matrix functions. These dynamic quantities can be estimated by matching corresponding space-time points with similar local motion and shape. For periodic motion, we match corresponding points across periods and develop a RANSAC procedure to simultaneously estimate the period and the dynamic geometric transformations between periodic views. Using this method, we demonstrate detection and segmentation of human periodic motion in complex scenes with nonrigid backgrounds, moving camera and motion parallax.},

abstract = {The instantaneous phase estimated by the Hilbert transform (HT) is susceptible to noise; we propose a robust approach for the estimation of instantaneous phase in noisy situations. The main procedure of the proposed method is applying an adaptive filter in time-frequency domain and calculating the analytic signal. By supposing that one frequency component with higher amplitude has higher signal-to-noise ratio, a zero-phase adaptive filter, which is constructed by using the time-frequency amplitude spectrum, enhances the frequency components with higher amplitudes and suppresses those with lower amplitudes. The estimation of instantaneous frequency, which is defined as the derivative of instantaneous phase, is also improved by the proposed robust instantaneous phase estimation method. Synthetic and field data sets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for the estimation of instantaneous phase and frequency, compared by the HT and short-time-Fourier-transform methods. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for temporal super resolution from a single quasi-periodic image sequence. A so-called reconstruction-based method is applied to construct a one period image sequence with high frame-rate based on phase registration data in sub-frame order among multiple periods of the image sequence. First, the periodic image sequence to be reconstructed is expressed as a manifold in the parametric eigenspace of the phase. Given an input image sequence, phase registration and manifold reconstruction are alternately executed iteratively within an energy minimization framework that considers data fitness and the smoothness of both the manifold and the phase evolution. The energy minimization problem is solved through three-step coarse-to-fine procedures to avoid local minima. The experiments using both simulated and real data confirm the realization of temporal super resolution from a single image sequence.},

abstract = {We propose a method for phase estimation of a single non-parametric quasi-periodic signal. Assuming signal intensities should be equal among samples of the same phase, such corresponding samples are obtained by self-dynamic time warping between a quasi-periodic signal and a signal with multiple-period shifts applied. A phase sequence is then estimated in a sub-sampling order using an optimization framework incorporating 1) a data term derived from the correspondences and 2) a smoothness term of the local phase evolution under 3) a monotonic-increasing constraint on the phase. Such a phase estimation is, however, ill-posed because of combination ambiguity between the phase evolution and the normalized periodic signal, and hence can result in a biased solution. Therefore, we introduce into the optimization framework 4) a bias correction term, which imposes zero-bias from the linear phase evolution. Analysis of the quasi-periodic signals from both simulated and real data indicate the effectiveness and also potential applications of the proposed method.},

The increased resolution can be in spatial or temporal dimensions, or even in both. We present a unified framework which uses a generative model of the imaging process and can address spatial super-resolution, space-time super-resolution, image deconvolution, single-image expansion, removal of noise, and image restoration. We model a high-resolution image or video as a Markov random field and use maximum a posteriori estimate as the final solution using graph-cut optimization technique. We derive insights into what super-resolution magnification factors are possible and the conditions necessary for super-resolution. We demonstrate spatial super-resolution reconstruction results with magnifications higher than predicted limits of magnification. We also formulate a scheme for selective super-resolution reconstruction of videos to obtain simultaneous increase of resolutions in both spatial and temporal directions. We show that it is possible to achieve space-time magnification factors beyond what has been suggested in the literature by selectively applying super-resolution constraints. We present results on both synthetic and real input sequences.},

Furthermore, noncardiologists can learn focused critical care echocardiography and adequately interpret the information obtained. Noncardiologists can also successfully incorporate focused critical care echocardiography into advanced cardiopulmonary life support. Formal training and proctoring are important for safe application of focused critical care echocardiography in clinical practice. Further outcomes-based research is urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy of focused critical care echocardiography.},

  abstract={Purpose: Image-guided cardiac interventions involve the use of fluoroscopic images to guide the insertion and movement of interventional devices. Cardiorespiratory gating can be useful for 3D reconstruction from multiple x-ray views and for reducing misalignments between 3D anatomical models overlaid onto fluoroscopy.
Methods: The authors propose a novel and potentially clinically useful retrospective cardiorespiratory gating technique. The principal component analysis (PCA) statistical method is used in combination with other image processing operations to make our proposed masked-PCA technique suitable for cardiorespiratory gating. Unlike many previously proposed techniques, our technique is robust to varying image-content, thus it does not require specific catheters or any other optically opaque structures to be visible. Therefore, it works without any knowledge of catheter geometry. The authors demonstrate the application of our technique for the purposes of retrospective cardiorespiratory gating of normal and very low dose x-ray fluoroscopy images.
Results: For normal dose x-ray images, the algorithm was validated using 28 clinical electrophysiology x-ray fluoroscopy sequences (2168 frames), from patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy procedures for heart failure. The authors established end-systole, end-expiration, and end-inspiration success rates of 97.0%, 97.9%, and 97.0%, respectively. For very low dose applications, the technique was tested on ten x-ray sequences from the RFA procedures with added noise at signal to noise ratio (SNR) values ofmath formula, math formula, math formula, math formula, math formula, math formula, and math formula to simulate the image quality of increasingly lower dose x-ray images. Even at the low SNR value of math formula, representing a dose reduction of more than 25 times, gating success rates of 89.1%, 88.8%, and 86.8% were established.
Conclusions: The proposed technique can therefore extract useful information from interventional x-ray images while minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Technological progress in recent years has made it possible that ultrasound industry can now offer affordable, portable and battery-operated ultrasound systems the size of a laptop computer. The purpose of this study was to compare these hand-carried ultrasound instruments with standard echocardiography in order to investigate the facility of a rapid bedside diagnosis in patients with suspected or known cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients were studied with miniaturized ultrasound equipment (SonoHeart) and a conventional scanner (Acuson Sequoia) in a blinded manner. All studies were performed by three board-certified cardiologists skilled and experienced in echocardiographic practice. Investigators were not aware of any previous medical reports. RESULTS: With the new system, adequate images could be obtained in all patients. Left ventricular and left atrial diameters measured with the hand-held system correlated well with those obtained with conventional scanning: r = 0.87, mean difference 3.12 +/- 2.7 mm and r = 0.84, mean difference 2.8 + 2.4 mm, respectively. The presence of left ventricular dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormalities, relevant valvular regurgitation (moderate or more) or valve stenosis was correctly diagnosed in all patients. However, there was a tendency towards underestimating the extent of wall motion abnormalities particularly in patients difficult to image. Discrepancies also frequently occurred in patients with trivial or mild regurgitation, where false-positive and false-negative findings were described. CONCLUSION: Currently available hand-held echocardiography systems can facilitate rapid bedside diagnosis and patient screening. However, this recent development in echocardiography also raises a number of questions and its actual impact on general clinical practice still remains to be evaluated.},

abstract = {Spatial Super Resolution (SR) aims to recover fine image details, smaller than a pixel size. Temporal SR aims to recover rapid dynamic events that occur faster than the video frame-rate, and are therefore invisible or seen incorrectly in the video sequence. Previous methods for Space-Time SR combined information from multiple video recordings of the same dynamic scene. In this paper we show how this can be done from a single video recording. Our approach is based on the observation that small space-time patches (\&\#x2018;ST-patches\&\#x2019;, e.g., 5\&\#x00D7;5\&\#x00D7;3) of a single \&\#x2018;natural video\&\#x2019;, recur many times inside the same video sequence at multiple spatio-temporal scales. We statistically explore the degree of these ST-patch recurrences inside \&\#x2018;natural videos\&\#x2019;, and show that this is a very strong statistical phenomenon. Space-time SR is obtained by combining information from multiple ST-patches at sub-frame accuracy. We show how finding similar ST-patches can be done both efficiently (with a randomized-based search in space-time), and at sub-frame accuracy (despite severe motion aliasing).

Super-resolution is performed simultaneously in time and in space. By "temporal super-resolution," we mean recovering rapid dynamic events that occur faster than regular frame-rate. Such dynamic events are not visible (or else are observed incorrectly) in any of the input sequences, even if these are played in "slow-motion." The spatial and temporal dimensions are very different in nature, yet are interrelated. This leads to interesting visual trade-offs in time and space and to new video applications. These include: 1) treatment of spatial artifacts (e.g., motion-blur) by increasing the temporal resolution and 2) combination of input sequences of different space-time resolutions (e.g., NTSC, PAL, and even high quality still images) to generate a high quality video sequence. We further analyze and compare characteristics of temporal super-resolution to those of spatial super-resolution. These include: How many video cameras are needed to obtain increased resolution? What is the upper bound on resolution improvement via super-resolution? What is the temporal analogue to the spatial "ringing" effect?},

Methods and Results We used an ECG-gated 3D IVUS image acquisition workstation and a dedicated pullback device in atherosclerotic coronary segments of 30 patients to evaluate (1) the feasibility of this approach of image acquisition, (2) the reproducibility of an automated contour detection algorithm in measuring lumen, external elastic membrane, and plaque+media cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and volumes and the cross-sectional and volumetric plaque+media burden, and (3) the agreement between the automated area measurements and the results of manual tracing. The gated image acquisition took 3.9{\textpm}1.5 minutes. The length of the segments analyzed was 9.6 to 40.0 mm, with 2.3{\textpm}1.5 side branches per segment. The minimum lumen CSA measured 6.4{\textpm}1.7 mm2, and the maximum and average CSA plaque+media burden measured 60.5{\textpm}10.2\% and 46.5{\textpm}9.9\%, respectively. The automated contour-detection required 34.3{\textpm}7.3 minutes per segment. The differences between these measurements and manual tracing did not exceed 1.6\% (SD\&lt;6.8\%). Intraobserver and interobserver differences in area measurements (n=3421; r=.97 to.99) were \&lt;1.6\% (SD\&lt;7.2\%); intraobserver and interobserver differences in volumetric measurements (n=30; r=.99) were \&lt;0.4\% (SD\&lt;3.2\%).
